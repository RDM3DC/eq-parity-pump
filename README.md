# Parity Pump (πₐ-gradient ℤ₂ flip mechanism)

**ID:** `eq-parity-pump`  
**Tier:** derived  
**Score:** 63  
**Units:** OK  
**Theory:** PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS  

## Equation

$$
\varphi(t) := \frac{\theta_R(t)}{2\pi_a(t)},\qquad \int_\gamma d(\ln\pi_a)\neq 0 \;\Rightarrow\; b_a[\gamma]\text{ can flip}
$$

## Description

Novel mechanism: parity can flip due to geometry-field motion, not only due to circling a branch point. A Z₂ pump controlled by ln(πₐ) dynamics. Conjecture: if Δθ=0 but ∫ d(ln πₐ) ≠ 0 over a closed loop, admissible lifts exist where b_a flips — the adaptive-π analog of geometric phase without dynamical phase.

## Assumptions

- Smooth limit applies (continuous π_a and θ_R).
- π_a > 0 everywhere (no degenerate period).
- Parity pump conjecture assumes closed-loop topology with nontrivial ln(π_a) circulation.
